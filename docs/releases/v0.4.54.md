# Release v0.4.54 - Collab Sync Robustness

**Release Date:** February 6, 2026

## Overview

Fixes collaborator sync crashes and makes the onboarding flow more resilient. Sync commands now auto-create missing branches and fall back to the user_id hash when no user_name is configured.

## Fixes

### Auto-create collaborator branch on sync

`collab sync`, session hooks, and `collab daemon` now automatically create the `collaborator/{name}` branch if it doesn't exist, instead of crashing with a `git checkout` error. This handles the case where a collaborator cloned the repo but registration didn't fully complete.

### Fall back to user_id when user_name is missing

If a collaborator never set their `user_name`, all sync paths (`collab sync`, `collab daemon`, server lifespan hooks) now fall back to the `user_id` hash (e.g. `collaborator/6adf5513`) instead of refusing to run. A dim notice is printed so they know to set a proper name later.

## Changes

### Added

- **`_ensure_branch()`** helper in `collab/sync.py` — tries checkout, falls back to `create=True`

### Changed

- **`collaborator_pull()`** and **`collaborator_push()`** use `_ensure_branch()` instead of bare `git.checkout()`
- **`collab sync`** CLI falls back to `user_id` if no `user_name` is set
- **`collab daemon`** CLI falls back to `user_id` if no `user_name` is set
- **Server lifespan** uses `member.user_name or user_id` for session sync hooks

## Test Coverage

- Python: 481 tests passing
