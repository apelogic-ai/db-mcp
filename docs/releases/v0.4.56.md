# db-mcp v0.4.56

## Highlights

### Collab Attach / Detach
New commands for retrofitting existing connections with shared team knowledge:

```
db-mcp collab attach git@github.com:org/db-knowledge.git
db-mcp collab detach
```

**Attach** merges a team's shared knowledge repo into an existing local connection. Your local files are preserved, the team's examples/learnings/schema are merged alongside, and you're automatically registered as a collaborator. Conflicts are detected and reported for manual resolution.

**Detach** cleanly removes the repo link while keeping all local files intact. Re-attachable anytime.

This enables the key onboarding flow: a user sets up db-mcp locally, builds their own knowledge, and later connects to a team repo without losing anything.

## Breaking changes
