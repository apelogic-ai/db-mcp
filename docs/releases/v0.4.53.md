# Release v0.4.53 - Collaborator Onboarding UX

**Release Date:** February 6, 2026

## Overview

Improves the collaborator onboarding experience for the collaborative git sync protocol. Adds a `collab join` command and moves the user name prompt earlier in the brownfield init flow.

## Highlights

### `db-mcp collab join`

New command for collaborators who already have a connection cloned but weren't registered (or need to re-register). Prompts for name, creates the collaborator branch, and pushes. No need to delete and re-clone.

```bash
db-mcp use dune
db-mcp collab join
```

### Early Name Prompt in Brownfield Init

`db-mcp init <name> <url>` now prompts for user name immediately after cloning, before asking for credentials. Previously the prompt was buried in auto-registration and could be missed if anything interrupted the flow.

## Changes

### Added

- **`db-mcp collab join`** command -- register as collaborator on an existing connection with `.collab.yaml`

### Changed

- **Brownfield init** prompts for `user_name` right after clone, before credential prompts

## Test Coverage

- Python: 481 tests passing
- UI E2E: 77 tests passing (Playwright)
