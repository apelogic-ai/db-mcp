# db-mcp v0.4.41

## Highlights
- Fixed macOS binary being killed on launch due to corrupted code signature
- Added SQL execution support for SQL-like API connectors (Dune Analytics, etc.)

## Breaking changes
- None

## Features
- SQL-like API connectors now support `execute_sql()` for direct SQL execution. Configure `supports_sql: true` and `sql_mode: api_sync` in connector.yaml, with an `execute_sql` endpoint. Supports both sync APIs (results in response) and async APIs (poll for results via `execution_status` and `execution_results` endpoints).

## Fixes
- Fixed macOS binaries failing to launch with "Killed: 9" error. The GitHub Actions runner's PyInstaller was producing binaries with invalid adhoc signatures. Added explicit `codesign --force --sign -` step after build to ensure valid signatures.

## Security
- None

## Upgrade notes
- If you previously installed 0.4.40 and it wouldn't run, simply re-install: `curl -fsSL https://download.apelogic.ai/db-mcp/install.sh | sh`

## Known issues
- None
